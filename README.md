Pharmaceutical Management System is a simple console-based application written in **C++** that demonstrates core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts. It was developed as a **university project** to help me understand how OOP principles like classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and file handling can be applied to build a basic pharmacy management tool.

This system simulates the fundamental operations of a small pharmacy, allowing users to manage medicine inventory and transactions through a text-based interactive menu. It’s designed to be clear, extensible, and easy to explore for anyone learning C++ and OOP.

## 🛠️ Features

✔️ Add and manage medicine records
✔️ Update existing medicine details
✔️ Search and view inventory
✔️ Delete obsolete or expired items
✔️ Basic sales/transaction logic
✔️ Data handling using C++ classes and file I/O
✔️ Modular code structure that highlights OOP usage

## 🧠 Purpose

This project serves as a learning example for:

* Understanding core OOP principles in practice
* Building a structured C++ console application
* Implementing simple data persistence using files
* Practicing menu-driven user interfaces in command line

## 📦 Getting Started

To run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gh0st2487/Pharmaceutical-management-system.git
   ```

2. **Open in a C++ IDE or compiler**

   * e.g., Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, Dev-C++, g++, etc.

3. **Compile the source files**

4. **Run the executable and follow the console menu**

## 📘 Learning Outcomes

By exploring this codebase, you’ll get hands-on practice with:

* Class design and object creation
* File input/output handling in C++
* Managing program flow with menus
* Structuring a small real-world inspired project

## 📌 Notes

This is a **basic academic project**, not a full commercial grade pharmacy system. It covers the essentials of OOP and can be expanded with features like GUI, database connectivity, or advanced inventory logic.
